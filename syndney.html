    <h1>CHILDREN'S DAY</h1>
    <p>Children's Day began on the second Sunday of June in 1857 by Reverend Dr. Charles Leonard, pastor of the Universalist Church of the Redeemer in Chelsea, Massachusetts:
        Leonard held a special service dedicated to, and for the children.<br> Leonard named the day Rose Day, though it was later named Flower Sunday, and then named Children's Day.<br>
   Children's Day was first officially declared a national holiday by the Republic of Turkey in 1920 with the set date of 23 April. Children's Day has been celebrated nationally since 1920 
   with the government and the newspapers of the time declaring it a day for the children. However, it was decided that an official confirmation was needed to clarify and justify this celebration and the official declaration was made nationally in 1929 by the founder and the President of the Republic of Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk.[6][7][8] 
   International Children's Day<br>
   International Children's Day was first proclaimed in Geneva during the World Conference on Child Welfare
    in 1925. On 4 November 1949, 1 June was established as the International Day for Protection of Children by 
    the Women's International Democratic Federation in Moscow.[1] Since 1950, 1 June is celebrated as Children's Day in many Communist and post-Communist countries.
